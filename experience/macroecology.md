# Macroecology of African vertebrates2

Macroecology is the study of the emergent ecological properties at large spatial and temporal scales.

My PhD research studied the geographic distribution data of 4,423 species of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals for continental Africa and Madagascar. These data were from the [IUCN Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org/) and [BirdLife International](https://www.birdlife.org/), and were combind with environmental data and custom simulations to explore historical and contemporary range dynamics.

More recently, I am studying whether Modern Coexistence Theory can be applied at large spatial scales. This entails combining trait data of African mammals herbivores, with dietary information from stable isotopes to quantify whether niche differentiation is sufficient to allow for coexistence between competing species.
