# Mitigating biodiversity loss

* Simulated biodiversity dynamics to explore a global mitigation hierarchy for a post-2020 biodiversity framework.
* Modelled the conservation costs and economic benefits of using biodiversity offsets to meet international protected area targets in
partnership with South African National Biodiversity Institute.
* Developed analytical and simulation models for averted loss and restoration biodiversity offsets, as well as cumulative biodiversity
impacts.
